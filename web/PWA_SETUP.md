# 📱 PWA Setup Guide

## ✅ Phase 1 Complete: Basic PWA Foundation

Your PlotMint app now has basic PWA capabilities installed! Here's what was added:

### 🔧 What's Been Set Up:
- ✅ Vite PWA plugin configured with minimal settings
- ✅ Basic web app manifest (makes app installable)
- ✅ Automatic service worker generation
- ✅ Placeholder PWA icons created

### 📱 Current PWA Features:
- **Installable**: Users can now install PlotMint as an app on their devices
- **Auto-updating**: Service worker automatically updates when you deploy new versions
- **Basic caching**: Static assets are cached for faster loading

### 🎨 Next Steps (Optional):

#### 1. Replace Placeholder Icons
The current icons are just placeholders. Create proper PlotMint icons:

**Required icon sizes:**
- `pwa-192x192.png` (192x192 pixels)
- `pwa-512x512.png` (512x512 pixels)
- `favicon.ico` (32x32 pixels)
- `apple-touch-icon.png` (180x180 pixels)

**Design recommendations:**
- Use your PlotMint logo/branding
- PNG format for app icons
- Square aspect ratio
- High contrast and simple design for small sizes

#### 2. Test Installation
- Open your app in Chrome/Edge
- Look for "Install" button in address bar
- Or use browser menu → "Install PlotMint"

#### 3. Future Enhancements (Phase 2)
- Custom install prompt button
- Offline functionality for reading stories
- Push notifications for new chapters
- Background sync for draft saving

## 🛡️ Safety Notes:
- All existing functionality remains unchanged
- PWA features are purely additive
- Easy to disable by removing the VitePWA plugin if needed
- No risk to current user experience

## 🚀 How to Test:
1. Run `npm run dev` as usual
2. Open the app in a modern browser
3. Check browser developer tools → Application → Manifest
4. Look for install prompts in supported browsers

Your app is now a PWA! 🎉
